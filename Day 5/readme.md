 Day 5: While Loop
## **Task**: Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop and print it in the same line.

**Description**:
A `while` loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `True`.

**Example**:
```python
# Initialize the counter variable
i = 1

# While loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
while i <= 5:
    print(i,end" ")
    i += 1  # Increment the counter by 1

Output: 
1 2 3 4 5
