 Day 2: Print Function #1
## **Task**: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints the sum, difference, product, quotient, floor division and remainder (if the second number is not zero) of those two numbers.

**Description**:
### Basic Arithmetic in Python

Python provides simple operators for basic arithmetic operations:
- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.  
  ```python
  sum = 5 + 3  # Output: 8
  ```
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.  
  ```python
  diff = 5 - 3  # Output: 2
  ```
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.  
  ```python
  product = 5 * 3  # Output: 15
  ```
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another (returns a float).  
  ```python
  quotient = 5 / 3  # Output: 1.6667
  ```
- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Returns the integer quotient.  
  ```python
  floor_div = 5 // 3  # Output: 1
  ```
- **Modulo (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division.  
  ```python
  remainder = 5 % 3  # Output: 2
  ```
These operators make basic calculations easy and efficient in Python.
